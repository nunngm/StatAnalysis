\usage{
aoMatrix(
  mat,
  color = bluered(50),
  display_numbers = TRUE,
  scale = "none",
  Rowv = NULL,
  Colv = NULL,
  clustering_distance_rows,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{a matrix to be plotted}

\item{color}{color pallete ( a vector of colors)}

\item{display_numbers}{whether to display numbers}

\item{scale}{ways to scale the values}

\item{Rowv}{either NULL or a vector of integers for row ordering}

\item{Colv}{either NULL or a vector of integers for column ordering}

\item{clustering_distance_rows}{distance measure used in clustering rows. Possible 
values are \code{"correlation"} for Pearson correlation and all the distances 
supported by \code{\link{dist}}, such as \code{"euclidean"}, etc. If the value is none 
of the above it is assumed that a distance matrix is provided.}

\item{clustering_distance_cols}{distance measure used in clustering columns. Possible 
values the same as for clustering_distance_rows.}

\item{clustering_method}{clustering method used. Accepts the same values as 
\code{\link{hclust}}.}

\item{return}{whether to return a list of orders}

\item{annotation}{data frame that specifies the annotations shown on top of the 
columns. Each row defines the features for a specific column. The columns in the data 
and rows in the annotation are matched using corresponding row and column names. Note 
that color schemes takes into account if variable is continuous or discrete.}

\item{...}{additional parameters to be passed to aheatmap (pheatmap)}
}
\description{
this is an enhancement of aMatrix where one can specify Rowv and Colv as in heatmap.2
typical application is that one can need to order according to a phenotype, i.e. EMT score
}
\details{
The working horce is aMatrix (more precisely its code). We only need to computer row order and column order and pass the reordered matrix to aMatrix.
Ordering is determined first by looking at Rowv and Colv. If either one is not specified, order is computed based on clustering with a given distance and linkage rule. 
If even clustering is not specified, then there is no ordering.
