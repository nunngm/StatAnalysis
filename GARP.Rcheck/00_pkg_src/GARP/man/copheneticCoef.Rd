\title{calculate cophenetic coefficient for a hierarchical clustering result}
\usage{
copheneticCoef(dist, hclust)
}
\arguments{
\item{dist}{a dist object which can be constructed by dist, ClassDiscovery::distanceMatrix, ade4::dist.binary or my binaryDist function}

\item{hclust}{a hclust object returned by hclust function (either from stats::hclust or fastcluster::hclust}
}
\value{
a correlation coeficient scalar
}
\description{
To compute the Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient of hierarchical clustering, we need two informations: Distance matrix  and Cophenetic Matrix 
Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient is simply correlation coefficient between distance matrix and Cophenetic matrix
As the value of the Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient is quite close to 1, we can say that the clustering is quite fit. A random data would have Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient
near 0.
