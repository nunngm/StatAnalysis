\title{generate breaks for an input matrix or vector}
\usage{
generate_breaks(x, n, midpoint = NA, center = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a matrix or vector}

\item{n}{desired number of intervals, which corresponds to n+1 breaks}

\item{midpoint}{midpoint. default is NA, which will be recomputed as the middle point of the value ladder (mean of c(min, max)). 
This is equivalent to no midpoint at all, and hence the default way}

\item{center}{whether to generate breaks centering 0 by expanding the values and hence, waste some colors (not recommended if the data is skewed)}
}
\value{
a vector of break points
}
\description{
this is an wrapper for genbreaks which is more straightforward
}
\details{
enhenced with midpoint
