\title{prepare a matrix for plotting by converting it to a color matrix}
\usage{
makeColMat(mat, colmap, na.name = "NA")
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{the original matrix}

\item{colmap}{either a named vector or a 2 column matrix specifying old/new mapping. This might be constructed from namedColVec which handles NA}

\item{na.name}{when there is NA, colmap must have specified how to map na.name to its color. So to index mat where there is missing val, we replace missing val with na.name}
}
\value{
the color matrix as well as colorfacs for legend returned as a list
}
\description{
this is an application of mapNames4mat() function that maps values to a color space.
}
\details{
this is a safe way to map value to color 1-to-1 since we can specify the old value and the new value
deliberately.
NA can be handled easily
}
